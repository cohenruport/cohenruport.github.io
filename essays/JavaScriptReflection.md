  I think that javascript is a good language I like how versatile it is since you can use your objects for many different things. And the fact that functions are first class and treated as objects makes them very intuitive for me. The objects are a little less intuitive and it has been weird getting used to declaring variables without a type since all of the other languages I’ve used such as java and c++ require keywords like int or string. 
  Aside from the syntax and object differences, javascript is pretty intuitive for me and it is nice to use. I think that it is overall a good language for software engineering since it is intuitive and easy to understand as well as being very clean and efficient as far as I know. I think the hardest part of JavaScript so far for me has been that there are some entirely different practices from languages i've learned in the past such as variable declaration and no need for classes which I haven’t dealt with much before
  I think that athletic software engineering has been great for me so far. I think one of my biggest issues so far in school has been that I will often forget the specifics of a language such as syntax or specific useful functions but athletic software engineering has helped me to thoroughly understand and learn javascript and I haven’t had troubles that I had in the past when learning other languages. I think that the practice WODs prepared me well for the process of quickly solving problems and have helped me develop a proper process to solve coding problems. I’ve learned to develop as I think, basically write down the bare bones such as the data structure I intend to use or the logic/loops of my program and then implement the specifics of the problem.
  This style of learning definitely works better for me as it helps me get practice that I wasn’t getting before. It also helps me to work quickly which is something that I’ve never practiced before. I also like that there are almost daily exercises between the WODs, homeworks, and practice WODs so I am quickly learning and maintaining my knowledge better since I am practicing JavaScript more consistently than I had practiced any language in the past. This style of learning is more enjoyable for me because it is less consequential to make mistakes. Since the problems tend to be harder but shorter than coding projects I've done in the past it is easier to catch errors but I still have to think hard and solve complex problems. Because of this I think that athletic software engineering will work great for me.
