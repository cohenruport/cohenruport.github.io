  I started software engineering very late compared to most students. I had never coded before college, I really just chose computer science since it sounded the most engaging and promising career wise. Despite coming into this major without any experience I’ve quickly developed a passion for it. For me the amount of work that coding requires makes it so much more rewarding.

  Despite not having experience with coding I was able to learn quickly by learning to learn. I realized as soon as I started coding that one of the most important skills as a software developer is being able to learn new things and solve problems. This approach is what makes software development fun for me. I like to build things from scratch and learn along the way; it makes me feel more accomplished when I am able to make my code run.

  I think my main goal with computer science is software development. It is really all I have any experience so far and I think it is the most interesting career for me since there are so many opportunities with so much variety. I want to do some fullstack projects as I don’t have any fullstack experience yet. I also want to gain more experience working on projects with other people. I think this is one of the most important skills for software development as it is the most realistic way to work; most projects are too large and complex for one person to complete efficiently. 

  I know I have a lot of skills I need to develop in order to pursue software development but it is exciting to know that there is so much more to learn and do in this field. The main skill I want to develop is full stack engineering. I want to gain more familiarity with a larger variety of languages, frameworks, and tools. Currently most of my computer science experience is with just coding which I am more comfortable with so I think I need to develop more comfortability with other tools and skills.
