  Although I donâ€™t have much experience with UI frameworks I feel that there is no major downside. Getting used to frameworks can be troubling as it can sometimes feel like you are learning a whole new language, but the tradeoff is that you are able to develop much more efficiently. It speeds up the process of frontend development especially since when developing web pages there are so many small specifics that you have to adjust and perfect. The reason most developers hate frontend, myself included, is that you need to find all the right colors, fonts, padding text size, and every other minute detail in order to get your UI to where you want it to be. This is what makes frameworks so useful. They take care of a lot of the specifics of frontend development and let you focus on the format and functionality of the page without needing to figure out the small details.

  In my personal experience one of the most important parts of using frameworks is the documentation. Documentation allows you to quickly figure out what solutions the framework has to the problems you are trying to solve. For example I used Bootstrap 5 to recreate a webpage.

  Using the documentation for Bootstrap I was able to quickly understand how to create a navbar, footer, and insert images and logos. The documentation of frameworks and languages is in my opinion one of the most important resources for developing software. It allows you to easily reference different functions built into the language or framework you are using so that you can easily implement them.
