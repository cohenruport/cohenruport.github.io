summary: "I was part of a team of volunteers at a local rock climbing gym who helped with the construction of a new wall"
---

I work with the routesetters at volcanic rock gym and to further expand the gym we have built a wall from scratch and constructed another wall which was made by a different company. The wall that the gym ordered uses RGB lights in order to show you what holds on the wall you are supposed to grab. I helped to wire the 300+ holds so that they light up properly according to the associated app. 

Additionally I helped to construct a wall from scratch.
